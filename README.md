MongoDB is a NoSQL database.  Rational databases are generally controlled with SQL (Structured Query Language) Popular ones include MySQL, SQL Server and PostgreSQL.

NoSQL databases in contrast are often called non-relational databases. They're a database not structured like a spreadsheet - i.e less rigid than an SQL databse.

The architecture of MongoDB is a NoSQL database which stores info in the form of collections and documents. MongoDB stores one or more collections. A collection represents
a single entity for example in an e-commerce app we need entities like categories, users, products etc. 
Each of these entities would be a single collection in the DB.

In MongoDB, a collection contains documents. A document is an instance of the entity containing the various 
relevant field values to represent the document.

E.G a product document will contain 'title', 'decription' and 'price' fields. 
Each field is a key-value pair e.g prce: 26, title: "Learning Node"
